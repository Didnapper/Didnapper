Welcome to Overkill Edition: The version of Didnapper for masochists.

List of Changes: 
Overkill Edition 1.1 (01/30/2018)
Hi everyone, this is just an update to fix some of the most glaring issues reported for the previous version.

Compatability with Suki/Carol/Cherisa
	- Suki and Carol are now subject to the same absurdity as Athena and Evelyn when attempting to escape from chains.
	- Cherisa is in a more rudimentary stage as I can't really make adequate art for her.
Practice fight results: Added from Yuti's mod, plus my edits.
	- Your allies will send you off to escape from some prison upon defeating you, and you can do the same to them. (So far tested with Athena/Evelyn) 
Normal Escape Level: Escape level now works normally again, and can still be set to 1 while escaping using the cheat "LVLDOWN"
New Cheats: (To be applied while escaping)
	- "CHAIN" Activates chains if not already applied.
	- "LVLDOWN" Sets Escape level to 1.
	- "NORM" Removes additional restraints (Straitjacket, Ridiculous Chains, etc.)
	- "CHAIN" Switches to chains if currently in ropes (You can also just press and hold the "W" key)
	- "LVLDOWN" Sets escape level to 1.
	- "ROPE" Switches to ropes if currently in chains.
	- "IAMNOOB" Switches to ropes AND resets all meters to positive values, removing the blindfold entirely.
	
	- "LOCK" and "BUNNY" still work, see previous.
	
Escapable additional restraints
	- Random chance to escape (1 in 150) whenever struggling in additional restraints. (will set arms meter to -250)
Blind Effects
	- Screen darkens corresponding to level of blindfold.
	- (The second Level of darkness feels a bit too much so i'll probably change that later.)
Sounds
	- Some edits to sounds for struggling
Struggle timer
	- Timer shortens as arms meter is more negative. Experimenting witht this.
Timer cutoff
	- If you miss while struggling, the timer is immediately cut off.

Still working on fixing the character switcher and expanding the new areas I created. Escaping from the areas themselves
has not been tested. Please tell me of any (of the many) bugs you will find. Thanks for downloading, hope you enjoy!


Fixes from previous version:
- No longer freezes upon trying to enter basement floor of lair
- Fewer issues with teleporting the player to the wrong place after losing a battle
- Infinite loop upon failing the pirate escape no longer occurs
- Fixed crashes at certain points in missions


KNOWN ISSUES:
- Character Switcher breaks the game
- Guards teleport the player elsewhere
- Guards to not work correctly
- Tilesets are messed up for collision


F.A.Q.

Q. How do I access the new areas?
A. Step on the pink rug in the Lair's Main Hall, above the left hallway.

Overkill Edition 1.0 (12/20/2017)
Beware: The saving error with "time must be positive" still occurs. Try sleeping a few times to fix it.
This mod is essentially contains two new areas: the "Desert Challenge" and "Winter Prison". They escape sequences which I am implementing with new game mechanics
and graphics from other modders and artists. Most of the stuff is done with photoshop, just altering and pasting images.

Of course MANY thanks to the entire crew behind Didnapper, all my fellow modders, and of course YOU, who have provided the assets and soul to this project.

- New Hub area:
	- The Hub has been updated to be less of a mess.
		< For Desert Challenge
		> For Winter Prison
			> Interior
			V Exterior
- Progressive Restraints:
	- As the Arms Meter descends farther into negatives (beyond -250), the restraints on the player will be visibly more strict (and ridiculous)
	Currently this is only implemented for chains on Athena and a straitjacket on Evelyn. (Working on Suki/Carol)
		- Being in this state actually reduces the effectiveness of ALL struggling. This can make it impossible to escape without the guard's mercy
		to release you from the additional restraints.
	- As of now, I've only created 1 additional "stage" of restraints, but in the future things could go even further,
	or add more intermediary stages.
	- The different stages could conceivably be separated between arms, legs, gag, and blindfold as well, but this needs some more work.

Magical Security:
- Upon a missed struggle, All restraint meters automatically go down (left) by 20 points, even re-binding your legs, re-gagging- or re-blindfolding you if they were free!
- On Athena, having an arms meter below -700 activates the Emergency Prisoner Restraining Rune, rapidly draining all restraint meters left whenever an attempt to struggle
is made. 
	- This also causes the time points to rapidly tick downwards during struggle.

- Character Selection:
	- The Lair Main Hall now has some chess pieces you can use to change characters.
		- I'm trying to add the ability to play as other character's we haven't gotten a chance to yet, such as Alyssa, Cherisa, or even our lord and savior Leroy.
		- I've had some issues when switching from another character to Suki, as the game brings up her old models from 1.6 in some instances and breaks the game.

- Desert Challenge Area:
	- Being updated and expanded. Will probably turn into a rescue mission of sorts too.
	- Pit traps scattered around can cause an instant gameover. Trying to figure out how to change that into something more interesting.
- Sprites added:
	- When in chains, the character's overworld sprite actually shows grey chains! How cool is that? (Currently only for Athena and Evelyn)

- Winter Prison
	- A prison run by Ghiaccio Guards
	- Has a regular cell block and a secure single cell.
	- If you annoy the guard too much (Failed charm, struggling noise), you will no longer have the option to charm or knock them out. 
	Instead, the guard will immediately tighten your restraints upon investigating you.
	- When chains are active, you will need to find a lockpick to free your arms. If you are carrying the lockpick and 
	the guard tightens your restraints for any reason, however, she will find and confiscate it.	
	- The outside area has nothing in it for now
	- The interior will be expanded in the future, possibly for a mission-esque kind of thing.

- Blind and Helpless:
	- Blind Meter value under -100 REMOVES THE STRUGGLE ARROWS! Have fun not escaping.
		- After  bit of testing, I changed this to re-reveal the arrows if you guess right once, resetting the Blind Meter to 0.
		- In the future i'll try to add a screen-darkening effect to this too.

- A Hardcore experience:
	- If you so wish, you can disable cheats by entering the code "LOCK"
	- Additionally, the code "BUNNY" activates the maximum progressive restraints phase.
Notes:
All the fights are really unwinnable at the moment, things will get tweaked.

I still need to figure out how to make proper guard behavior. Until then, there will just be a lot of guards running around randomly that will crash into you sometimes.
I'm also trying to figure out a way to make failing one escape sequence lead to another escape sequence. Everything I've tried so far has either not run at all or
worked for the first struggling but then the screen goes black and the escape sequence cannot continue. 

This is very much still a work-in-progress, with many unfinished and bugged things scattered around the game. Please bring them to my attention if you find any!
Suggestions are always welcome.

Hope you enjoy!

IN THE WORKS:
- Vine escape:
	- Though I'm seriously lacking in the art department, it's possible to simply replace the normal ropes in an escape sequence with green
	vine-looking things. Not sure how high interest in that would be, so I've held off on it for now.

PREVIOUS CHANGES
v0.9:
Escape System:
- No more safetey net: 
	- There is no longer a maximum to the tightness of restraints, so getting caught by a guard 
	  at a seemingly "full" meter will put the value off the charts, maybe even off the screen!
- Athena: NEW Escape perk:
	- Successful ‘hits’ while struggling add to a variable (+35), like the opposite of Carol’s perk.
	- When the variable crosses certain thresholds, she gains a bonus to all types of struggle.
	- When she misses during struggle, the variable gets -1000.
	- Attempting to struggle while the variable is below a certain negative value will:
      	  - On miss: Lose a time point
      	  - On hit: Heavily subtract progress on the struggle meter
	- While struggling, the variable also quickly ticks down, so you must be active and quick.

- Carol: More polarizing perk
	- The bonus and penalty for Carol's perk have been made substantially more pronounced.

- Evelyn: More tired
	- She has a constant (-2) instead of (-1) while gagged. Why? Maybe she liked being tied up now.
- Escape training
	- The guard will now check and tighten the player's restraints if she makes too much noise.

New Areas:
- "The Hub": Walk on the upper discolored tile in the Main Hall of the Lair
	- Desert Challenge: Walk straight left upon entering the Hub onto the Red Carpet
		- There are some bags on the ground the player can interact with. There is a random chance that they will either:
			- 1) Loosen arms significantly 2) Forcibly lock the player in chains/ropes
		- If you manage to get loose and fight the guards, chances are the fight won't go well for you, so there is another option:
			- Escape through a loose grate in the wall 
		- The chains on your arms and your gag cannot be unlocked without a key. It is located somewhere on the top wall and will
		allow you to struggle free. (Not sure if it works properly).
	- All the other special tiles transport the player elsewhere, but most are dead ends or simply warps to other parts of the game.
	- You can start a fight with Marcia and her goons by talking to her.
Play as other characters:
- You can roam around the world and do missions as Carol, Athena, or Evelyn Alone. 
  However, going outside towards the carriage adds Suki back to the party and removes the others. I'm not yet sure how to fix this.


Notes:
- I had a mechanic in place that would constantly "drain" the struggle meters to the left while
  struggling, but removed it for now because it made the ridiculousness too ridiculous.
- I've been trying to add graphics for more extreme restraints as the struggle meters go further into the negative 
(chains attached to the walls, more chains, hoods, etc.), but I lack art and the necessary skill with RPG Maker for now.

Known issues:
- When legs are freed, sometimes bound legs are shown. (Resolved)
- Various graphical errors with face animations/struggle animations
- Guards do not function properly. 
- Most of the Guards in the desert challenge don't teleport the player to the correct place.
- Blindfold sometimes does not darken correctly while moving.
- Text boxes are in the wrong place. (Issue found)

I mostly playtested this with Athena in mind, so other characters may not have as polished an experienced or as many special interactions. 
(I didn't implement any graphics for chains on Evelyn or Carol, for example)

All these changes are just experimental, and not really balanced or fair. Feel free to suggest changes because I was mostly just messing around while making this.

Thanks for trying it out!
