For most of the features, you have to complete the main part of the game before.

Tickling minigame:

During this minigame, you have to press arrows keys (like when you're escaping).
When you press these keys, it stops the progression bar for a time.
The aim of the game is to avoid the progression bar to reach the end of the line.
You have to resist for 50 seconds.

Training for this minigame:

Go talk to the woman on the main hall of the lair.
If you loose, it will trigger a random punishment event. (go see this section below)

Challenge minigame:

During this minigame, you're tied up, and you have to escape before your opponent.
It's like a traditional escape game, but with a turn by turn system.
Freeing you legs give you 2 possibilities:
- Use chloroform on your opponent
- Tight the ropes of you opponent
Your opponent can do same things to you.

If you win this minigame, you'll obtain 5 challenge points.
If you loose, it's ends up with a tickling minigame.
In case of loose of the tickling minigame, it will trigger a random punishment event. (go see this section below)

Go to the challenge room which is located on the left side of the trophy hall.
There are two new characters, Jasmine and Misa.
These girls can launch a challenge game, tell you about the challenge room, or tell you how many challenge points you have.
You can also fight them, but you need to have at least 100 challenge points.
If you loose, the same thing that if you loose a challenge.

For now, there are 3 opponents: Rissete, Evelyn and Cherisa

Random punishments:

These events are triggered usually when you loose a tickle game (but not in all case)
There are 9 events possibilities:

- Being take to a cell in the huston village (you have to escape)
- Being taken to the nomad tent in the desert. (you have to escape)
- Being taken to the tent in Florian (you have to escape.)
- Being taken to the private cell (if not occupied) it going to choose one of your allies (if not in the cell) to keep you during an escape sequence.
If all your allies are in jail, you'll free yourself.
- Being locked in a closet of a noble woman, she's going to found you and sent you to jail (you have to escape)
- Being taken to a tent in the slaver camp (you have to escape)
- Being taken to a guild cell and locked for 2 minutes
- Being taken to the sellable captives cell and locked for 3 minutes
- Be tied up in Huston village and found by Cilie who untie you after 2 minutes (launch the Cilie side quest.)

If you complete the game, the girls you can capture (lost forest, Madinah, Ghiaccio, not the beach) will trigger a random punishment if you loose gainst them. (instead of a game over)

Cilie side events:

In huston village, there is a girl named Cilie.
To trigger these events, you have to trigger the last random punishment once.
When it's done, you can came back to the Huston village and tie her up anytime.
Also, there will be a pole on the north of Madinah town. (next to the raid her archeologist)
You can perform self-bondage on this pole, if you do, cilie will come and play a tickle game with you.
If you win, you'll be untied, but if you loose, an archeologist will kidnap you and send you to a nomad tent.
So, it's the start of some events with Cilie which will end to a quest...(but not created yet, fr now, you can only trigger these two events)


New angel side quest:

There is a new side quest which is a sequel to the initial angel sidequest.
You have to complete the original quest and have unlocked all your allies. (and, they must not be lock in their cells!)
Go to the Ghiaccio Inn and go sleep to the bed on the left room.
It will trigger the quest.

CHEATS:

BARESET : Reset the quest with Alysa and the burglar.
ANGREVRESET : Reset the new angel side quest.
CPA : Give you 5 challenge points.
CPB : Take you 5 challenge points.
CILIE0 : Reset the Cilie's event.
CILIE1 : Make the first cilie's event complete (so, you can go directly to the second on Madinah town.)

If some of these events can't be triggered, please chek you've actually completed the main part of the game

-----------------------------------------

Reminder about the first version of this mod:

The previous version allows you to:

- Being taken to private cell by your allies (with some other events...)
- Do a side quest with Evelyn if you beat her. ("sell her" option)
- Do a side quest where the burglar and Alysa escape

------------------------------------------

As I'm french, there is still vocabulary and grammatical mistakes, I'm really sorry about this.
I try to fix a bit of them, but there is still plenty of them...
The dialogs when your allies take you to the private cell are still the same as Carol (if you want to help ith that, please contact me!)

If some developers are interested, I have a git repository where I work on the mod on bitbucket, so, if you want to participate, please contact me!
